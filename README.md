##List of the different scripts

  * **selfout_importdata.R:** script that is used to import and format the raw data. This script is for "internal" use only. It creates the input datafile that are used in the 'selfout_loadata.R' script
  * **selfout_loadata.R:** script you have to run before any other scripts (except for 'selfout_importdata.R')
  * **selfout_colonization.R:** script for analyzing colonization of patches during the epidemic (*i.e.* intra epidemic season)
  * **selfout_LD_subsample.R:** script to split the data set in different subpopulations so that LD tests can be done taking into account the possible geographical structuration of the populations
  * **selfout_samplingmap.R:** script to plot the sampling maps for each year of the survey (2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013)
  * **selfout_glm.R:** script for the generalized linear model used to analysis the impact of coinfection on different life traits of *P. plantaginis*
